# Pokemon-project
> Welcome to the second review of my project called "Pokemon"! This was my second school project in which I had to demonstrate teamwork skills as well as the use of an open API. And this time, xxx technologies and its Express component were used, along with EIS. By the way, this time I specialized on the backend side, so my team did the visual part. Let's get to the project!

> The main page meets us at first glance with an incomprehensible field with scattered pokeballs, as well as a little man in the middle. But this is all only at first glance ... the little man can be controlled using the arrows on the keyboard and thereby collect pokeballs. In general, this is something like a mini-game, but it does not set any goal for the user, that's all. In the navigation panel, the "Kotisivulle" element, which returns to the main page, then "Pokémons", redirecting to the page with all Pokemons, but more on that separately. And I promised in the last showcase of the first school project - the search technology, which was transferred from a separate page to the navigation panel, but the name of the pokemon still needs to be written completely and without errors. Otherwise - an error appears.

> Next comes the page itself with all the Pokémons. In this project, everything is divided into several pages, with navigation buttons at the bottom. As you can see, there are only two buttons on the first page at the bottom, the first is "Seuraava sivu", which flips the page to the second, and also "Viimeinen sivu", which flips to the last page. In general, navigation buttons are made in such a way that if, for example, the user is on the last page, then he will not have a next page button, and with the first page, there will not be a previous page button.

> Page with information about the selected Pokémon. From the card you can see the ID of the Pokémon in the Pokédex, its weight, type, ability, as well as a description of the effect of using the ability. At the bottom of the card there is a chain of evolution of this Pokémon. Basically, Pokémon have three stages of evolution, sometimes there are two, and sometimes none at all. This is all taken into account and it will not be such that there will be just empty circles with nothing inside. If there is no stage of evolution, the circle is not shown at all. In case of complete absence of the chain of evolution - the window is not shown.

> Under the information about the Pokémon there is a slider, by clicking on one of the elements, the user is redirected to the same page with information about the Pokémon that was in the element.

> The last thing is the error page. It appears when the user misspelled the name of the requested Pokémon in the search bar and pressed enter.
