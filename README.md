# Pokemon-project
> Welcome to the second review of my project called "Pokemon"! This was my second school project in which I had to demonstrate teamwork skills as well as the use of an open API. And this time, xxx technologies and its Express component were used, along with EIS. By the way, this time I specialized on the backend side, so my team did the visual part. Let's get to the project!

> The main page meets us at first glance with an incomprehensible field with scattered pokeballs, as well as a little man in the middle. But this is all only at first glance ... the little man can be controlled using the arrows on the keyboard and thereby collect pokeballs. In general, this is something like a mini-game, but it does not set any goal for the user, that's all. In the navigation panel, the "Kotisivulle" element, which returns to the main page, then "PokÃ©mons", redirecting to the page with all Pokemons, but more on that separately. And I promised in the last showcase of the first school project - the search technology, which was transferred from a separate page to the navigation panel, but the name of the pokemon still needs to be written completely and without errors. Otherwise - an error appears.
